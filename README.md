## ⚡Overview of the analysis:

The objective was to get a list of tradable cryptocurrencies and classify them using unsupervised machine learning.

 + First the data was cleaned and processed.
 + Clusters were made using the K-means algorithm.
 + Centroids were determined using the elbow curve (4).
 + PCA was used to limit features and speed up the model.

## ⚡Results:

**The raw data had 1252 rows:**
